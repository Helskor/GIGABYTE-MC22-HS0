# GIGABYTE-MC22-HS0
documentation for the GIGABYTE MC22-HS0 motherboard (lacking in official documentation)
Product page: https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G182-C20-rev-100

This motherboard came out of the GIGABYTE G182-C20 (rev. 100) server
Official documentation: https://download.gigabyte.com/FileList/Manual/server_manual_e_G182-C20_v1.0.pdf

As this isn't a motherboard sold in standalone some features are not documented and GIGABYTE support wasn't willing to help.

I'll compile any findings here
